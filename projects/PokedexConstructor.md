summary: "I developed a code to create and destroy objects based on when that specific member function is called."
---

This code simply instantiates a constructor which would be called to create a member of the object and a deconstructor which
is called at the end to delete said member.
These are for which are called implicitly which means that they are not to be explicitly called.
This starts to lean towards being more object oriented to which it focuses more on the object of the class, rather than the
variable.

The code essentially is a Pokedex entry of three Pokemon, each of the Pokemon are called within the Pokemon class, and they can be given attributes, names and types.
Each of the objects are created in the beginning, given their respective names and types, and then deconstructed in the end.
Here is an example of the code.
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <map>

#include "pokemon.h"
#include "wartortle.h"
#include "charmeleon.h"
#include "caterpie.h"

using namespace std;

/*****************************************************************
//  Function name: checkPokedex
//  
//  DESCRIPTION:   A polymorphic function which retrieves from the 
//                 data the information that was stored in the map
//                 and prints out each pokemon
//
//  Parameters:    Pokemon *pokemon: Each child class pokemon with
//                 the given nickname
//
//  Return values:  none
//  
****************************************************************/

void checkPokedex(Pokemon *pokemon)
{
    pokemon->printData();
}

/*****************************************************************
//  Function name: main
//  
//  DESCRIPTION:   The main function whose job is to create a vector of
//                 names, store those names, give the corresponding names
//                 to each child class pokemon and call them using
//                 checkPokedex. For vector, push_back was used to insert
//                 names in the vector and for map, string is the key and
//                 pokemon pointer is the value, insert puts the names in the
//                 map and make_pair links the pokemon pointer (nickname) and
//                 the actual name of the pokemon.
//
//  Parameters:    none
//
//  Return values:  0: Success
//
